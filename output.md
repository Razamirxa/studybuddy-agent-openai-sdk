Hey there! It's totally normal to have trouble focusing sometimes, so don't beat yourself up about it. Let's see if we can get you back on track.

First off, try breaking your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. The Pomodoro Technique might be helpful: study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four "pomodoros," take a longer break of about 20-30 minutes.

Also, make sure you're in a comfortable environment with minimal distractions. Maybe find a quiet corner in the library or your room where you won't be disturbed.

Remember to take care of yourself! Get enough sleep, eat well, and stay hydrated. Your brain will thank you for it!

What small step can you take today to improve your study environment or routine?
